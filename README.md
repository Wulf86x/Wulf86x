<!--
**Wulf86x/Wulf86x** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a labeling application
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and Android Studios
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...likely everything! Totally new to this but I realise I need to know how to build the app myself instead of having to rely on anyone or paying people with such skills. Not gd for P&L
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Singapore.. Food.. Soccer.. Liverpool
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: lqc1986@hotmail.com
